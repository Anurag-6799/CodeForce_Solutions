[Anurag Singh (singhanurag6799)](https://codeforces.com/profile/singhanurag6799)

## Repository Structure
For every problem, I create a dedicated folder containing 3 files:
1. `solution.cpp` - The source code.
2. `input.txt` - Problem input.
3. `output.txt` - Problem output.

The executable files are excluded from this repository.
